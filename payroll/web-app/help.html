						<strong class="question">Why do I have to pick a state?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>It’s super important to choose your state first so that the calculator can include the state taxes (and local taxes, if any) that must be withheld from an employee’s paycheck. We can calculate paychecks only for employees who live and work in the same state.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">What taxes am I responsible for?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>As an employer, you’re responsible for the following:</p>
						    <p>Employee Taxes — We calculate employee taxes for you on paychecks. Employee taxes can include federal, Social Security, Medicare and, in many states, state income or disability taxes. Additionally, some employees owe local taxes depending on their location of residence or worksite location. You report and pay these to the government agencies on your employee’s behalf.</p>
						    <p>Employer Taxes — As an employer, you’re also responsible for some additional taxes that we do not calculate, including the employer’s portion of Social Security and Medicare, federal unemployment (FUTA) and, in many states, state unemployment (SUI). You report and pay these to the government agencies.</p>

						<h4>Pay Date</h4>
						<strong class="question">Can I enter dates in the future or dates from last year?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Yes and yes! As long as the future date is within the same calendar year – we don’t know the 2014 tax rates yet. (You can calculate checks farther in the future, but we can’t be sure the taxes will be accurate.) Past dates should be accurate for the last 5 years.</p>

						<h4>Pay Period</h4>
						<strong class="question">Why do I have to pick a pay period?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>It’s important to use a consistent and reliable pay schedule so that tax calculations are correct. Taxes calculated for a weekly check, for example, will come out slightly different than a biweekly check. It also helps you keep payroll taxes and accounting straight throughout the year.</p>
                        </div>
						<strong class="question">Why don’t you offer more pay periods like monthly or quarterly?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>We’d love to, but our crew of developers is pretty small! Unfortunately, if you pay someone quarterly, annually or by project, your tax calculations won’t be correct using our calculator.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h4>Pay Type</h4>
						<strong class="question">What about overtime, bonuses, and commissions?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>You can find them in the next section under Additional Pay. (Please keep in mind, if you pay someone annually or by project, your tax calculations won’t be correct using our calculator.)</p>
                        </div>
						<strong class="question">What about deductions like garnishments or health insurance?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Sorry, but we don’t cover deductions! If you really need deductions and contributions, you should try one of our <a href="http://payroll.intuit.com" target="_blank">Intuit Payroll options</a>.</p>

						<h4>Hourly – Hours Worked</h4>
						<strong class="question">How do I enter overtime hours?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>In the Hours Worked box, enter the regular hours. Then click Additional Pay, and enter the remaining overtime hours. (For more info, see Additional Pay section.)</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h4>Hourly – Pay Rate</h4>
						<strong class="question">Can I enter other pay rates?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>We support hourly pay rates only. Sorry, no per diem (per day), per unit, or project rates.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h4>Salaried – Pay Amount</h4>
						<strong class="question">Should I enter only the gross salary amount for this pay period?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Yes! That’s perfect. We’ll calculate all the taxes and show you the net check amount.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h4>Gross YTD (Year-to-Date)</h4>
						<strong class="question">What if I don’t have the gross year-to-date amount?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>If you don’t enter the year-to-date amount, our calculator might calculate too much tax. Some state and federal taxes have an annual maximum amount for earned income, also called a ‘wage base’. Once an employee reaches the annual maximum, they don’t need to pay any more of that tax for the remainder of the year. For example, the Social Security tax wage base is $113,700 for 2013. If your employee has already earned more than that amount year-to-date, then they don’t need to pay any more Social Security until the next tax year begins. Without a year-to-date amount, our calculator won’t know if a maximum has been reached.</p>

						<strong class="question">How do I know which hours are overtime?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>In general, if you chose weekly for the pay period, enter up to 40 hours in the Hours Worked field, then enter the remaining overtime hours in Additional Pay > Overtime worked. If you chose biweekly for the pay period, you would pay overtime based on a 40 hour work week for each separate week. Any hours worked over 40 in a single week would be overtime hours.</p>
						    <p>Each state has its own laws and guidelines that determine normal and overtime hours. For details about the overtime laws in your state, check the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm" target="_blank">state labor agency list</a>.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">How is overtime calculated?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Our calculator uses an overtime rate of 1.5 times the employee’s regular pay rate for every overtime hour worked. (Double-time is not supported.)</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">How are commission and bonuses calculated?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Bonuses and commissions are added to, and calculated with, the employee’s regular pay. For example, let’s say an employee works 40 hours during a pay period and also gets a $100.00 sales commission. When you create the employee’s paycheck, you enter 40 hours worked and enter $100.00 in the commission field. The calculator adds the $100.00 commission amount to the employee’s regular pay when calculating the employee’s paycheck.</p>

					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">What about reimbursing employees for expenses?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Since most reimbursements aren’t considered wages, they aren’t generally taxed or included on employee paychecks.</p>

					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">How do I know what to enter for these questions?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>Have your employees fill out the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf" target="_blank">federal W-4 form</a> (PDF) and your state’s withholding form. (If there is one; many states don’t have separate forms. Check the State Withholding section for more info.). The filing status and the allowances or exemptions entered on the form(s) help us figure out federal and state taxes. Remember to keep the completed forms in your company records.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">What if my employee hasn’t filled out the form yet?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>You can still calculate paychecks. Until you have a completed form from your employee, we’ll use the highest agency default rates when calculating your employee’s paycheck.</p>
                        </div>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<strong class="question">What if my employee says they don’t have to pay taxes?</strong>
                        <div class="answer">
						    <p>If your employee writes 'Exempt' in box 7, then no federal income taxes are withheld. (Exempt employees, with just a few exceptions, will still continue to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes.) Different states use different terminology for employees who do not need to pay taxes. Some states use 'zero percent' or 'exempt'. If your employee claims zero percent or exempt status, choose Do Not Withhold for their federal and state filing status. If you’re not sure or don’t have the forms, choose a filing status like Single instead.</p>

						    <p>For many states, counties, and localities, this information is required for accurate paychecks. (If it wasn’t required, we promise we wouldn’t ask!) Knowing where your employee lives or works helps us to calculate local taxes.</p>
